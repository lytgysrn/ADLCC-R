# A-DLCC

This repository contains R code for **Automatic Depth-based Local Center Clustering (A-DLCC)** via \$\beta\$-integrated local depth and adaptive grouping, as described in our work.

**Note:**
The codebase is not very clean and may contain redundancies or insufficient comments. Please use with discretion.

## File Structure

* `Function_adlcc.R`:
  All functions for the implementation of A-DLCC, including integrated local depth, local center detection, adaptive grouping, and clustering assignment.
* `run_example.R`:
  Example scripts demonstrating how to run A-DLCC on synthetic and real datasets.
* `plot_func.R`:
  Collection of functions for visualization using ggplot2 .

## Datasets

## Disclaimer

The code is research-oriented. For questions or suggestions, please contact the authors.
